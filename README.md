This is the project report of Kinker paper.

Memo:
Single-cell data is being used widely. Single cell technologies refer to technologies that take into account the heterogeneity of a tissue.
scRNA-seq technology basically means RNA-sequencing technology for single cells (RNA-seq technology is the technology used to get transcriptome data, i.e data about the RNA sequence)
Cancer cell lines are just cell lines derived from cancerous cells. Cell lines are groups of cells growing and dividing indefinitely. They're made in the laboratory as models for experiments.
The KSQ or the Key Scientific Question talks about how we can use scRNA seq data of cancer cell lines to explore how the following FDA drugs can also be used for other cancers:
1. Trastuzumab targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. HER2 is an epidermal receptor protein which is overexpressed in cancerous states of the body, and remains underexpressed in normal states.
2. Bevacizumab targets VEGF which is a signaling protein, helps in the formation of new blood vessels and in vasodilation as well. If VEGF is overexpressed, it can lead to metstatic cancers. Solid cancers by themselves cannot metstasize, but if cancerous cells gain the ability to produce VEGF, they can easily form new blood vessels and be transported through blood and metastatize. Bevacizumab is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.
